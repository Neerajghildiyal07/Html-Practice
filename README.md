## What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the basic framework of websites by defining the content and structure of the webpage. HTML consists of a series of elements or tags that tell the browser how to display the content. Some of the most common elements include:

- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Links (`<a>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
- Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`)
- Divs and sections (`<div>`, `<section>`)

HTML works in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create rich, interactive web experiences.

## What I Have Practiced

In this repository, I have explored and practiced several key aspects of HTML to build a strong foundation for web development. Here's a breakdown of what I’ve worked on so far:

### 1. Basic HTML Structure
I started with the essential structure of an HTML document, including the use of:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
- Meta tags for setting character encoding, viewport settings, and page titles (`<meta>`, `<title>`)

### 2. Headings, Paragraphs, and Text Formatting
Practicing different text elements:
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Line breaks (`<br>`)
- Emphasizing text with `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, and `<u>` tags

### 3. Links and Navigation
Explored how to create hyperlinks using anchor (`<a>`) tags. This includes:
- Linking to internal and external pages
- Adding tooltips using the `title` attribute
- Opening links in new tabs with the `target="_blank"` attribute

### 4. Lists (Ordered and Unordered)
I practiced creating:
- Unordered lists (`<ul>`) with bullet points
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) with numbers or letters
- Nesting lists inside other lists for more complex structures

### 5. HTML Forms
I’ve experimented with creating forms for user input, including:
- Text inputs (`<input type="text">`)
- Password fields (`<input type="password">`)
- Checkboxes and radio buttons
- Drop-down menus (`<select>`)
- Buttons (`<button>`, `<input type="submit">`)
- Text areas (`<textarea>`)

### 6. Tables
Built various tables to display tabular data using:
- `<table>` for the container
- `<tr>` for table rows
- `<td>` for table data cells
- `<th>` for table headers
- Merged cells using `colspan` and `rowspan`

### 7. Media Embedding
Learned to embed different types of media on webpages, including:
- Images using `<img>`
- Videos using `<video>` and YouTube embeds
- Audio using `<audio>`

### 8. Semantic HTML
I’ve also focused on writing **semantic HTML** for better accessibility and SEO. This includes using tags like:
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` for webpage layout
- `<nav>` for navigation menus
- `<aside>` for sidebars and related content

### 9. HTML5 Elements
Finally, I’ve experimented with modern HTML5 elements such as:
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for image captions
- `<time>` to define dates and times
- `<progress>` and `<meter>` to display progress bars or values

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to dive deeper into advanced HTML concepts, including:
- HTML APIs such as **Geolocation** and **Canvas**
- Improving web accessibility (ARIA tags)
- Combining HTML with **CSS** and **JavaScript** for interactive and visually appealing web pages.
